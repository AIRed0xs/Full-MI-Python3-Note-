The default axis is 0. This is how the combined dataframes will look like if we change the axis to 1.

If you have worked with SQL, what pd.merge() does may be familiar. It links data from different sources (different features) and you have a control on the structure of the combined dataset.

Pandas Merge method(how): SQL Join Name : Description

* left : LEFT OUTER JOIN : Use keys or columns from left frame only

* right : RIGHT OUTER JOIN : Use keys or columns from right frame only

* outer : FULL OUTER JOIN : Use union of keys or columns from both frames

* inner : INNER JOIN : Use intersection of keys or columns from both frames

Joining is a simple way to combine columns of two dataframes with different indexes.

You can see that with df.join(), the alignment of data is on indexes.
