Here is the problem. There is a real state agent who knows that you're a Machine Learning Engineer and would like you to help out with building a machine learning model that can predict the price of the house given the information about that particular house\

You have understood the problem and probably you already have an idea of type of models you will use. You know there are so many models such as random forests, decision trees, and neural networks but you have learned that it's always okay to start simple and so, now you know you will use Linear Regression as this is not a complex problem.

Understanding the problem well goes beyond determining the right models for the problem, but also to doing effecting data processing and error analysis as you will be finding out.
