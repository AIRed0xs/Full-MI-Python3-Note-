We have already seen that the model was simple, so one might try other complex models such as Random Forest, decision trees, or ensemble methods
Since we will be covering those models in the next labs, let's save this option for then. Also, it's important to note that most often, if you have a simple dataset, simple models will work well since complex models can overfit the data. Also, good model comes from a good data, so it's best to spend time curating data than bouncing back and forth in models.
