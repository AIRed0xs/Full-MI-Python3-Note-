MorePlots

We can use plot() to create more plot types. Here are the following types that we are going to see in this notebook:

    Bar plot
    Histogram
    Box plots
    Area plots
    Kernel Density estimation plots (KDE)
    Scattter plots
    Pie charts

We can also plot stacked bar plots. We will have to set stacked to True.

Use .barh() to create horizontal bar charts

You can also create histograms easily with dataframe.hist(). We saw this in the beginning.
