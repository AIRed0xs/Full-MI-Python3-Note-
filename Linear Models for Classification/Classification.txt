#Problem Formulation

Let's say you have an idea of a revolutionary mobile phone and you want to establish a start up, but you know little about the price of the mobile phones. You are interested in learning that!

Fortunately, there is this mobile dataset on Kaggle that you can use to learn about the price ranges of mobiles based on their features such as wifi & bluetooth supports etc...

So, to make it simple, you have a dataset containing the features of mobiles and the problem is to predict the price range, not the exact price.

Finding the Data
The target feature is price range and it has four price ranges: 0(low cost), 1(medium cost), 2(high cost) and 3(very high cost).


    batter_power: Total energy a battery can store in one time measured in mAh
    blue: Has bluetooth or not
    clock_speed: speed at which microprocessor executes instructions
    dual_sim: Has dual sim support or not
    fc: Front Camera mega pixels
    four_g: Has 4G or not
    int_memory: Internal Memory in Gigabytes
    m_dep: Mobile Depth in cm
    mobile_wt: Weight of mobile phone
    n_cores: Number of cores of processor
    pc: Primary Camera mega pixels
    px_height: Pixel Resolution Height
    px_width: Pixel Resolution Width
    ram: Random Access Memory in Mega Bytes
    sc_h: Screen Height of mobile in cm
    sc_w: Screen Width of mobile in cm
    talk_time: longest time that a single battery charge will last when you are talking
    three_g: Has 3G or not
    touch_screen: Has touch screen or not
    wifi: Has wifi or not
    price_range: This is the target variable with value of 0(low cost), 1(medium cost), 2(high cost) and 3(very high cost).

There is another interesting insight to draw from the correlation. It seems that the feature fc(the megapixels of front camera) is correlated with pc which is the megapixels of the primary camera.
