Functions

Functions are used to write codes or statements that can be used multiple times with different parameters.

One fundamental rule in programming is "DRY" or Do not Repeat Yourself. Functions will help to not repeat yourself.

This is how you define a function in Python:

def function_name(parameters):

  """
  This is Doc String
  You can use it to notes about the functions
  """
  statements 

  return results

    function_name is the name of the function. It must not be similar to any built in functions. We will see built in functions later.
    parameters are the values that are passed to the function.

    Doc String is used to add notes about the function. It is not a must to use it but it is a good practice.

    return specify something or value that you want to return everytime you call or run your function.

As you can see, functions do not need to always have return. When you only want to display the customized message (not involving expression), print() will be enough.
