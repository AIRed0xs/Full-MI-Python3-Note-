Let's learn two more useful built functions: they are map and filter. You can try to explore or use more built in functions on your own

Map function

Map gives you the ability to apply a function to an iterable structures such as list. When used with a list for example, you can apply the function to every element of the list.

Let's see how it works.

Filter function

Let's say that you have a list of numbers and you want to filter the list and remain with odd numbers. Odd number is any number which can not be divided by 2.

You can develop a function to calculate it but you would have to always pass single value or values but not entire list.

Using filter, you can return true for every element of list evaluated by the function.
