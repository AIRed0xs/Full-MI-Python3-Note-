Control Flow

As an engineer, you will need to make decisions depending on the particular situation. You will also need to control the flow of the program and this is where Control Flow comes in.

We will cover:

    If statement
    For loop
    While loop

4.1 If, Elif, Else

Structure of If condition:

if condition:
  do something

else:
  do this

We can also put if condition into one line of code. This can be useful when you want to make a quick decision between few choices.

Here is the structure:

'value_to_return_if_true' if condition else 'value_to_return_if_false'

Let's take some examples...

For Loop

For loop is used to iterate over list, string, tuples, or dictionary.

Structure of for loop:

for item in items:
  do something



For can also be used to iterate over an sequence of numbers. Range is used to generate the sequence of numbers.

for number in range: 
  do something

One last thing about for loop is that we can use it to make a list. This is called list comprehension.

While loop

While loop will executes the statement(s) as long as the condition is true.

Structure of while loop

while condition:
  statement(s)
