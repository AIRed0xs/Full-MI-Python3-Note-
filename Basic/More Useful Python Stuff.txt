More Useful Python Stuff

Python is an awesome programming language that has a lot of useful functions.

Let's see more useful things you may need beyond what's we just saw already.

List Comprehension

List comprehension makes it easy to make a new list from an existing list based on a given conditions. It's very concise and readable.

Take an example for the following cases

Enumerate Function

Enumerate function convert iterable objects into enumerate object. It basically returns a tuple that also contain a counter.

That's sounds hard, but with examples, you can see how powerful this function is...

As you can see, each element came with index counter automatically. The counter initially start at 0, but we can change it.

Zip Function

Zip is an incredible function that takes two iterators and returns a pair of corresponsing elements as a tuple.

The zip object return nothing. In order to show the zipped elements, we can use a list. It's also same thing for enumerate you saw above.
