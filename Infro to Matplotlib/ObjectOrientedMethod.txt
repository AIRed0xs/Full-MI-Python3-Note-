If you want to create and customize figures, object oriented method is for you
This is the same as for subplots


You can also iterate through the axes of subplots. This would be very helpful if you have many rows and columns.

When using axes and subplots, the elements of figure can overlap. You can use plt.tight_layout() to correct that automatically.



Many functions will be same while using Matlab Interface or Object oriented except things like defining labels, title, which we already saw above.

To conclude the object oriented interface, you could use the function ax.set() and include all the plot things immediatey like xlim, ylim, xlabel, ylabel, title.
