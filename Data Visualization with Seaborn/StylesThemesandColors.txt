Seaborn allows to customize the visualizations depending on our needs. We may want to have control on the plot styles, colors. Let's see how that works.

Styles and Themes

There are five styles in Seaborn: darkgrid(default), whitegrid, dark, white, and ticks.

Removing the Axes Spines

We can also use despine() to remove the top and right axes spines

We can also move the spines away from the data by setting the offset distance or points that spines should move away from the axes.


Size and Aspect

We can use Matplotlib figsize function to change the size of Seaborn plots.



You can also set the size of the plot by using parameters size and aspect but they do not work in all plots.
Scaling plot elements with the context

Context is used to control the scale of the elements of the plot. This can be really helpful depending on where you want to use the visualizations.

We use sns.set_context() to achieve that. There are four contexts: paper, notebook(default), talk, and poster.

But we also have to reset the style first.

Colors

Seaborn allows us to choose color that we think can make the visuals attractive.

With whole range of color palettes, there are so many options to choose from.

We can either use sns.color_palette() before each plot, or set palette inside the plot definition.



As you can see, it makes the plots more appearing. There so many palettes and here is the list. You can play with them to see what color matches your purpose.

To see the available color palettes, check out the documentation or this cheat sheet.

Lastly, you can use sns.set_theme() to directly set the style, palette, and context.
