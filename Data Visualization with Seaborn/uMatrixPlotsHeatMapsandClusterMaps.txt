In data analysis, sometime it is handy to visualize the data as color encoded matrices and can be used to find the clusters within the data.

Heat Maps

heatmap() will color the matrix.

Let's first see it for a numpy array and we will apply it to a real world dataset.

If you want to add the values in addition to color, you can set the parameter annot to True.

Cluster Maps

clustermap will plot the clustered heatmap.



So far, you have saw how flexible Seaborn is in visualizing data with different kinds of plots.

By default, the Seaborn plots are clear and good looking. But there are times you are going to need more attractive visualizations and that is what is coming up.
