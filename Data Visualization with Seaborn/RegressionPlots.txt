Regression Plots

Seaborn takes data visualizations to other extents: Not only you can plot features, but you can also plot the linear relationship between two variables (linear model).

Even if regplot() can be used for such goal, we will use lmplot().

Multiple Plots

Like we did before, we can make multiple plots by providing another variable to col and row.

One last thing about regression plot in Seaborn: We can also use jointplot() and pairplot() where we use reg in parameter kind
