You can see that even displaying information about the dataset, some features like deck or class have category as data typ

Mapping MethodÂ¶

Mapping method is straight forward way to encode categorical features with few categories. Let's apply it to the class feature: It has three categories: Third, First, Second. We create a dictionary whose keys are categories and values are numerics to encode to and then map it to the dataframe.

Warning: Ordinary Encoder can't handle missing values. It will be error. Try it on embarked and see..

Label Encoding

Label Encoding is noted to used for encoding target features (per sklearn documentation) but otherwise, it can also be used to achieve our purpose of encoding categorical features.

It also can't support missing values. So, to make it simple, let's drop all missing values.

Pandas Dummies

This is also simple way to handle categorical features. It will create extra features based on the available categories. Let's apply it to the feature who.

One Hot Encoding

This is the last encoding type of our list. It will convert a feature into one hot matrix. Additional features corresponding to the values of the given categories will be created. Basically same as dummies.
