Downside about this is that if the first value would be a missing value, then the rest are same. 
Also, see what happened at the index 97. 
The house with total rooms of 335 has a total_bedroom of 1331, which is impossible. 
All the method introduced above can led to serious bias or wrong results, leading to wrong decisions. Before we wrap how to fill missing values, 
let's also look at other ways you can use to fill the missing values. Say we want to fill all missing values by mean or median of a given column.

As you can see, the total_bedroom is filled with mean. 
Take for example at index 3 and 4.

But also this brings an issue. 
You will also find somewhere that the number of bedrooms are greater than the number of rooms in a house and that's again impossible and can lead to wrong analysis.
