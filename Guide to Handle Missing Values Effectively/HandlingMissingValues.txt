There are number of methods to handle missing values,
but basically, you can do one of these but keep in mind that each can affect our analysis:

*Removing the missing values
*Filling the missing values
*Leaving the missing values as it is.

Starting from the first one, if you were to remove the missing values, fairly simple. 
You can do the following, and you are done.

Now, you're done. 
However, you can wish to remove the missing values by a condition. 
In this case, you can do the following. 
Say you want to remove the columns that contain missing values. 
Since we don't have more than 1 of such columns, this will not change our dataset, but that's something you can try at your end.

As you can see, total_bedroom is removed. 
This is can however led to the loss of data that could be meanigful despite that it contains NaNs. 
If you wanted more control, then you can use 'threshold' to specify how many non missing values (minimum) to keep for a given column or row. 
We will not see the effect of this, but you can try that on your end.

Another Interesting thing here to try is to remove the rows or columns that are empty. 
This can save you time if you have hundreds of columns or rows that you want to remove specifically. 
When how is set to 'all', you are basically saying remove all columns which are all null (contain missing values). 
All the thing we saw so far involving the axis='columns', can be applied to rows
